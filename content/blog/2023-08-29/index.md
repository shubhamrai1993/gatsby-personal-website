This was a narration of Thucydides' work on Peloponnesian war who was a contemporary of the events being described. The narration was really crisp and chock full of information. That is also the reason it was a little heavy to read. Some helpful chart or mental map of the people involved would have been great but the sheer number of people who fought was too great.

Overall its a great read if you are interested in political history but you have to be okay to not be able to retain most of it
