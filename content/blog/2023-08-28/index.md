A very in depth history of Napoleon's initial rise to power. One thing I didn't like was the book seemed uninterested in the details of the course of battles as they happened and more in the repercussions on the general people, the overall politics and on Napoleon personally.

Its a good read if that's what you want but it won't satiate your curiosity of battle lines and tactics if that's your thing
